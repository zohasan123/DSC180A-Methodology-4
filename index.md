## **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered this quarter was using deep learning for x-ray image classification tasks, particularly leveraging advanced Resnet-50 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models.

## **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I’d like to investigate how to better optimize the prediciton of BNPP values within chest radiographs, and also explore new biomarkers for prediction.

## **3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would have potentially changed how I researched and learned about the foundation of CNN in radiography medicine, currently I am learning about is as I go but it would have been beneficial to set aside more time towards that learning.

## **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I’m interested in experimenting with ensemble learning methods and model interpretability tools like SHAP or LIME to better explain model predictions.
